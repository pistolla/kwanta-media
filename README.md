##KWANTA - (SWAHILI name for quanta) A MEDIA TOKEN WITH FIXED START VALUE THAT APPRECIATES WITH FACTS, DEPRECIATES WITH FICTIONS, THE MINIMUM BALANCE REWARDS THE STORY TELLER AND FACT/FICTION FEED 
###TLR; DR
Objective: Develop a dapp that registers and watch media url using tokens using cookie to manage, track and analyse media data trail. References, likes, in positives, while old(no update)

###WORK PLAN
Create a REACTJS app to register story tellers
register and track a media url using cookie
Collect FACT feed
Collect FICTION feed
Analyse the balance
A low fiction balance rewards the story teller 


###CONCEPT
Quoting Walter Benjamin "The value of information does not survive the moment in which it was new. It lives only at that moment; it has to surrender to it completely and explain itself to it without losing any time. A story is different. It does not expend itself. It preserves and concentrates its strength and is capable of releasing it even after a long time." 

Mr Walter Benjamin() was an idealist and most likely preluded a solution to a problem faced in this age of information. To grasp what i am trying to tell you, try to widen the scope of types of information media. 

This goes much deeper than that and the reason why there is an increase in fake news. For now we should be interested with the value of information in any publication whether, youtube video, instagram photo, Facebook post, New York Times article, tweet, novel, magazine, etc. If indeed a publication has a value, then it can be measured, managed and stored. B4 anything else lets differentiate the value of information and the value a reader gets by consuming the content.  I will liken the former with photons(packet of light) that carries some energy while the latter can be likened to energy(final product) plants gets after photosynthesis or Vitamin D for animals, when the photons from source reach is transmuted. We are interested with the former, value of information. And now i hope we are in same page.

###PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem statement is how we can reverse the rate at which value of information diminishes whereas the modes of information delivery have improved. we now store information on the Internet. This problem is growing across all cultures and accelerated by globalisation. African cultures are made up of story tellers in every community. And through stories wisdom was propagated through generations. We can ignore the fact even though they were not techies like todays culture but they managed to survive upto this age. 

###QUESTION - TEST CASE
The tough question is how do we ensure readers('plants and animals') receive the correct value of information('photons') direct from credible(with evidence) source while ignoring fake information from other sources?
