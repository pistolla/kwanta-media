## KWANTA - (SWAHILI name for quanta) 
### A MEDIA TOKEN WITH FIXED START VALUE THAT APPRECIATES WITH FACTS, DEPRECIATES WITH FICTIONS, THE MINIMUM BALANCE REWARDS THE STORY TELLER AND FACT/FICTION FEED 

### TLR; DR
Objective: Develop a dapp that maintains a ledger of media urls using tokens distributed via cookies to manage, track and verify sources, References, likes, and comments. 

### WORK PLAN
Create a Reactjs app to register story tellers

### CONCEPT
Quoting Walter Benjamin "The value of information does not survive the moment in which it was new. It lives only at that moment; it has to surrender to it completely and explain itself to it without losing any time. A story is different. It does not expend itself. It preserves and concentrates its strength and is capable of releasing it even after a long time." 

Humans have sought to store information persistently so that it does not loose this transient value. We had success with hardcopy publications and for a millenia, books were credible source of information. Then Internet(World wide Web) happened and the status quo changed completely. The cost of publishing and maintaining libraries diminished to almost zero. 

This goes much deeper than that and the reason why contrary to WWW success there is an increase in fake news. For now we should be interested with the value of information in any publication whether, youtube video, instagram photo, Facebook post, New York Times article, tweet, novel, magazine, math book, drawing book etc. 

If indeed a publication has a value, then it can be measured, managed and stored. B4 anything else lets separate the value of information from the benefit a reader gets by consuming the content.  I will liken the former with photons(packet of light) that carries some energy while the latter can be likened to glucose(final product) plants gets after photosynthesis or Vitamin D for animals, when the photons from source reach is transmuted. We are interested with the former, value of information. And now i hope we are in same page.

Mr Walter Benjamin was an idealist author, who foresaw the peril to the end of credible source of news/stories. We had already been accustomed to associate any publication with wisdom but it not so any more. His ideals preluded a solution to disinformation problem faced in this age of information which can be solved using a distributed network. To grasp what i am implementing, try to widen the scope and focus on different forms information media.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem statement is how we can reverse the rate at which unverified information reaches mainstream while still encouraging on the World Wide Web. Fake News/Misinformation is information that cannot be verified, is without sources and is possibly untrue This problem is growing across all cultures and accelerated by Social Media. African cultures were made up of story tellers in every community who passed wisdom through generations. We cant ignore the fact even though they were not techies like todays culture but they managed to survive upto this age. 

### QUESTION - TEST CASE
The tough question is how do we ensure readers('plants and animals') receive the credible information value('photons') supported from verifiable(with evidence) sources and pruning fake edges?
